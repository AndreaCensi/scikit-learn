    Creates a list of list containing the nearest neighboors for each point in

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : matrix
      The points to consider.

    neigh : Neighbors
      A neighboorer (optional). By default, a K-Neighbor research is done.
      If provided, neigh must be a functor. All parameters passed to this
      function will be passed to its constructor.

    n_neighbors : int
      The number of K-neighboors to use (optional, default 9) if neigh is not
      given.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example creates a graph from samples and outputs the
    first item, that is a tuple representing the distance from that
    element to all other elements in sample:
    
    >>> from scikits.learn.manifold.compression.tools import create_graph
