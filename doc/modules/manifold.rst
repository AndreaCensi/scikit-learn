Manifold Learning
=================

Introduction
============

Manifold learning is a set of dimensionality reduction techniques. They try to find an embedded space where 
the original data can be efficiently described. Then, other tools can create a mapping between the original 
space and the embedded one so as to allow classification, for instance, in the embedded space.

Dimensionality Reduction
========================

Dimensionality reduction is the set of tools that will actually search the embedded space. Each technique has 
its advantages and drawbacks, so you will have to select the correct one for your purpose.
